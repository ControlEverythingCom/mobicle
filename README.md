###What is Mobicle
>Particle created an amazing product(Spark-Core/Photon/Electron) which builds upon the Arduino architecture bringing cloud capabilities to the platform.  Particle served up IOT capabilities on a silver platter to Arduino users and in doing so made IOT something the average hobbyist/developer could easily digest.  It is a true game changer.  However, one missing link, we felt, has been an interface UI for controlling and monitoring those IOT devices you have worked so hard to create.  That is what Mobicle is all about.
Mobicle is a web based application built to interface with your Particle module through Particle’s cloud.  Mobicle is built on the cordova framework which lends itself well to many platforms including Android, iOS, Web Browsers, Windows, Blackberry, WEBOS, etc.

###What does Mobicle do

>Mobicle allows the user to call functions on Particle devices, monitor published events, monitor device variables, and publish events which devices can subscribe to.  We will continue to add features to Mobicle making it more robust to the user experience.

###Mobicle is open source
>Want to rebrand the application for your own use, change the layout of the UI, add functionality not currently available?  Fork the application from our GitHub repo and make any changes you want for personal or commercial use.  
Be our friend and contribute to the project. Rest assured your efforts will not be in vain.

###Why do it for free?
>Yes, Mobicle is free. We want everyone to have it. ControlEverything.com designed Mobicle as a way to give back to the Particle community. It does also give users a simple and consice interface to ControlEverything.com particle interface hardware but is by no means only compatible with our hardware.  It is very open and can be used to call functions, monitor events and variables through any firmware running on a Particle device.  Write your own firmware on the Particle module and interface to it through Particle’s cloud using Mobicle.  
Oh yeah and have fun!

###Updates and the Future of Mobicle
>The existing version of Mobicle that is available through [mobicle.io](http://mobicle.io), is now sunset. This does not mean we will remove access to it, it just means there is a feature freeze. We've decided to do this for 2 reasons:
 - First of all, a newer version of the client has been written and partially tested, that is what you see in the master branch of this repository. This version is much more robust and flexible and incorporates an object oriented approach much more successfully that the previous version. We do not plan on spending any time developing it right now, but are open to pull requests, and even some collaboration if it is something the community is interested in.
 - The more important reason is that we have, for the last couple of months, been working on a hosted version of Mobicle. This new version addresses some concerns we, and the community, have had. The 2 most important benefits that come from a hosted solution are security, and portability. As it stands now, your settings are saved on the browser you are using, and will not persist if your session is destroyed.

>We hope to have the Beta version of the new Mobicle available soon, and are excited to show you some of the more useful features that it can provide.
